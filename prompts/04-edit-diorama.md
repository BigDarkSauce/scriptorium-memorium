# Change a diorama

```text
You are editing an interactive 3D diorama spec.
CURRENT SPEC: {"type":"<paste the current spec JSON here>"}
SELECTED OBJECT: {"name":"<selected object, optional>"} (for built-in models, edits to objects live in "overrides" keyed by path, and new objects in "additions" (body specs))
VIEWER REQUEST: <what to change>
Return ONLY the complete new spec as JSON. Keep everything the request does not change (including overrides/additions). You may keep the type, change params/lessons/overrides/additions, or convert a built-in model into a full "scene" spec when the request needs new bodies, events or behaviour.
Built-in physical models (use {"type":<name>,"title":str,"params":{...},"lessons":[...]}): pendulum{L,g,theta0,damping} doublependulum{m1,m2,L1,L2,theta1,theta2,g,eps} spring{k,m,c,x0} projectile{v0,angle,g,drag} orbit{GM,r0,vfactor} collision{m1,m2,v1,v2,e} incline{angle,mu,m,g} lever{m1,x1,m2,x2,fulcrum,beam} wave{A,lambda,f,standing} gas{N,T} reaction{NA,NB,Ea,Eb,T} efield{q1,q2,d,qt,m} circuit{V,R,C,closed} lens{f,do,ho,sweep} surface{gravity,friction; "expr":"f(x,y)"} weatherglass{T,P,P0,auto,conc}. Any of them also accepts "technique":"card|sweep|topdown" and "lessons".
SCENE SPEC (type "scene") — a universal 3D diorama on a round display plinth (radius 7, top at y=0, units ≈ metres; keep content within |x|,|z| < 6.5, 0 < y < 8).

Shape kinds: box{w,h,d,round} sphere{r} cylinder{r,rt,rb,h} cone{r,h} torus{R,r} capsule{r,h} plane{w,h} disc{r} ring{ri,ro}
 extrude{points:[[x,y]...],depth,holes} (a 2D outline pushed along z — ideal for the sweep technique) lathe{points:[[r,y]...]} tube{points:[[x,y,z]...],r,closed}
 spring{R,r,turns,h} arrow{length,r} text{text,w,h,color} sign{text,w,h,post}

 grid{size,div} axes{size} glasscase{w,d,h} particles{type:rain|snow|dust|bubbles|stars|sparks,count,area:[x,y,z],speed} scale pulley{r} boat car group
Material presets: brass gold copper chrome steel iron mercury wood darkwood bark paper parchment card glass water ice plastic rubber ceramic stone marble plaster fabric leather foliage grass soil sand snow skin membrane gel emissive neon cloud smoke ink chalk
Expressions ("amount","speed", surface/curve): plain maths with + - * / ^ ( ), sin cos tan exp log sqrt abs min max pow, PI, E, t (seconds) and the param keys.
Techniques: "card" = a white card model on a drafting desk seen through a long lens; a light sphere turns card into real materials (good for objects, machines, organisms, economies).
 "sweep" = a section seen dead-on through an extreme telephoto; a vertical cut plane scans across turning ink into light (good for layered things: soils, cells, atmospheres, circuits, cross-sections, timelines).
 "topdown" = a plan seen from straight above; the section cut rises and the camera tilts into perspective (good for maps, networks, fields, populations, board-like systems).
CODE API (spec.code is the body of function(api), no imports/DOM/network):
 api.body(id) -> Object3D of a body; api.bodies(); api.param(key); api.set(key,value); api.p (live values)
 api.onStep((h,t)=>{}) physics substep h≈1/480 s (integrate here: semi-implicit Euler or RK4); api.onFrame((dt,t)=>{}) once per frame (move meshes here)
 api.event(text, Vector3|null, {id:"turning"}) logs + flashes; lessons can wait for it with "until":"event:turning"
 api.readout(name, ()=>number|string); api.plot(name, ()=>number) live sparkline; api.label(text, ()=>Vector3, describe) adds a significant body for the tour
 api.spawn(bodySpec, parent?) -> Object3D at runtime; api.remove(obj); api.shape(shapeSpec, materialSpec) -> Object3D (not added); api.material(spec)
 api.onClick(raycaster=>{}); api.camera({target:[x,y,z], r:distance, ph:polar, th:azimuth}); api.time(); api.THREE (three.js r170); api.V3(x,y,z); api.noise(x,y,z); api.rand(); api.fmt(n); api.clamp; api.lerp
 api.trail(maxPoints, hex) -> line with .add(vec3) (add it to api.world); api.world (Group)
RULES: physics/maths must be correct; every definition must be attached to visible bodies and to events; actors are the bodies the explanation is about (2–7 of them), decor gives place and scale and may react through behaviors (trees sway with wind, windows glow at night); lessons are 3–7 short steps, each changing something and pointing at what to watch; keep code under ~200 lines.
